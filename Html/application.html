                The principal,

                (School name),

                (School address),

                City.

                Subject: Application for Two days’ leave.

                Dear Sir/Madam,

                With due respect, I want to state that I am a student of Class 5th (say) in your school. 
                I have an emergency because I need to leave the town and stay out of the station for two days, i.e., 8th,
                 June 2021 and 9th, June 2021 (say). 
                So I will not be able to attend any classes during that period, and hence, I want to apply for leave for these two days.
                All my work is up to date, and I will cover the rest after returning.

                Kindly grant me leave for two days ( 8th, June 2021 & 9th, June 2021). It will be really helpful to me. 
                Thank you in advance for your consideration and cooperation in this matter.

                Thanking you,

                                                                        Yours obediently,

                                                                        (Name)

                                                                        (Class)

                                                                        (Roll no.)

                                                                        (Date)
